# AirTarget-DynamicData

As part of a team of 7 students, led by Reia Demont, we developed a collision detection/avoidance research flight simulator created in C#/Unity for the Oculus Rift. The project's goal was to create a simulator for a study to determine if flight training with virtual reality is beneficial to help pilots improve their avoidance skills. Each of us worked on separate portions and combined our code to create the final flight simulator.

This repository contains my portion of the code for our final project for CS498 SL (Virtual Reality - Oculus Rift Development) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

For Reia's graduate studies, a controlled experiment was performed with the simulator with aviation students and non-pilots. Some were trained with the Oculus Rift beforehand and some were not. Using the study results and data from our individual write-ups, including my UML diagram, Reia completed a paper titled "High-Fidelity Simulator VS Low-Fidelity Virtual Reality Simulator".
